// create a function called 'go' that takes 2 arguments: direction (forwards, backwards, etc.) and speed (mph). The function, when invoked, will print out the following in your console (for example): "The car is moving forward, at 25 mph."


// my version of the function
function go (direction, speed) {
    console.log(`The car is moving ${direction} at ${speed} mph`)
}

go("forward", 34)
go("backward", 5)
go("forward", 90)
